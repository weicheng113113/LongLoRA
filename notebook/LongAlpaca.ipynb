Conclusion and Future Work\\nThis   paper introduces Multi-modal   Iterative   Spatial- temporal Transformer for long-form VideoQA, which de- composes dense self-attention into a cascade segment and region selection module to increase the computation effi- ciency along with a self-attention layer to reason over vari- grained visual concepts. In addition, by iteratively con- ous ducting selection and attention layers; MIST better over performs multi-event reasoning: Experimental results on four VideoQA datasets show its effectiveness and advan- tages in efficiency and interpretability. For future work, al- though MIST has increased the number of sample frames the ability to capture high-frequency motion may still need In addition, patch features naturally have to be improved complex object-level reasoning: some limitations in Re- cently, there have been some pre-trained models for specifi- cally modeling actions and objects It may be interesting to try more types of pre-trained models Or even combine many reasoning: of them to achieve more general\\n4.6.

Sampling more video frames to capture high-frequency motion information better. The current model may still miss some fine-grained details due to sparse sampling.\\n\\n2. Using more powerful pre-trained models that specifically model objects and actions. The current patch-level features have limitations in complex object-level reasoning. \\n\\n3. Combining different pre-trained models to achieve more general reasoning ability. Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, so an ensemble may perform better.\\n\\n4. Handling longer videos that are more commonly seen in real-world applications. The current model focuses on efficiency but may still struggle with hours-long videos.\\n\\n5. Exploring spatial selection modules to reduce computation for high-resolution videos. The current model only uses region selection, but spatial selection may be useful for very complex videos.\\n\\nIn summary, sampling strategies, using specialized pre-trained models, and further improving efficiency for extremely long videos are potential directions to enhance the proposed model.</s>'}\n"
